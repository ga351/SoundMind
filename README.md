## Introduction

**SoundMind** aims to bridge the gap between audio processing and natural language understanding. By applying reinforcement learning to logic reasoning, we provide a robust framework for training models that can interpret audio signals and generate meaningful language outputs. This repository contains the code and resources needed to implement and experiment with our approach.

## Requirements

### Recommended Hardware

For optimal performance, we recommend using one of the following hardware setups:

- 8× NVIDIA H800 80GB GPUs
- 8× NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs

These configurations will ensure that your training and inference processes run smoothly.

### Codebase and Compatibility

Our codebase is built on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). If you are familiar with verl, you will find it easy to navigate through this repository. 

### Environment Setup

To set up your environment, we recommend using Anaconda. Here are the requirements:

- **Python**: Version >= 3.9
- **CUDA**: Version >= 12.1

Ensure you have CUDA and cuDNN installed to leverage better hardware support. The following versions are required:

- **CUDA**: Version >= 12.4
- **cuDNN**: Version >= 9.8.0

## Installation

To install the necessary packages and dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ga351/SoundMind.git
   cd SoundMind
   ```

2. Create a new Anaconda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n soundmind python=3.9
   conda activate soundmind
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure CUDA and cuDNN are properly set up. You can verify your installation by running:

   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can start using SoundMind. Here’s a brief overview of how to run the main scripts:

1. **Training the Model**:

   To train the model, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
   ```

   Make sure to adjust the configuration file as needed.

2. **Running Inference**:

   To perform inference on audio data, use:

   ```bash
   python inference.py --input audio_file.wav --output output_file.txt
   ```

   Replace `audio_file.wav` with your input audio file.

## Training

The training process is designed to be straightforward. You will need to configure the parameters in the `train_config.yaml` file. This file contains settings for:

- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Number of epochs
- Model architecture

After configuring the settings, run the training script. The model will save checkpoints periodically, allowing you to resume training if needed.

## Inference

Inference allows you to generate language outputs from audio inputs. The process involves loading a pre-trained model and passing audio files through it. 

### Steps for Inference:

1. Load the model:

   ```python
   model = load_model('path_to_model')
   ```

2. Preprocess the audio input:

   ```python
   audio_data = preprocess_audio('audio_file.wav')
   ```

3. Generate output:

   ```python
   output = model.predict(audio_data)
   ```

4. Save the output to a file or display it.
